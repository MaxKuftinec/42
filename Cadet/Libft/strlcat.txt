Strlcat
- Concatenate a string from src to dst with a specified size
- Null terminator of the dst string will be replaced with the first character of src and the concatenation starts here
- If the specified size is smaller than the length of dst, the function wonâ€™t operate on dst
- The return value is the length of (src + size). The value cannot exceed the sum of the length of both strings and cannot be lower than src. Regardless if the function does its operation or not, it always return a value

Len = src + size
Or 
Len = src + dst

If size > dst
	len = src + dst

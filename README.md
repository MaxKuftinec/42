<h1>42 CHARTER</h1>
You have succeeded the online admissions tests, congratulations!
The registration process to 42 continues with two important appointments:

- A meeting with us, the Introduction Session
- The “Piscine”

But before you meet with our team, we would like you to go through our 42 Charter for you to understand more about what you will experience at 42.

42 is a tuition-free computer programming school with a peer-to-peer learning environment that doesn’t involve teachers and lectures. It is an innovative educational model that was designed to develop the skills needed to jumpstart a career as a software engineer using a project-based learning approach. We’re not a traditional university, and we’re not a coding bootcamp.

Before living your passion in the company or the startup of your dreams, you will have to work hard… With an education designed to develop outstanding programming proficiency.

42 prepares you to meet the most demanding needs of innovating companies. Beyond simple technical expertise, we aim at excellence in programming. What is required of you to succeed in your training at 42? Easy...read the M.A.N!

<h1>M for My personal engagements</h1>
  
**You will need a minimum of 40 hours of work per week.** The goal of 42 if for you to become, in three to five years, an accomplished professional capable of handling heavy workloads. As such, from the beginning of your training until the end, you will be tackling many projects to train yourself. Being ahead of others because of your previous knowledge is a lure: by not working, you put yourself in difficulty compared to all those who develop their work capacity to catch up with you.

**Autonomy in your training.** 42 lets you organize yourself freely. Don’t think that knowledge will come to you: you become the actor in your studies the very first day in school. Once in the professional world, you will have to be active in the search for knowledge. AS of now, apply this work method. Be rigorous. When a project is given to you, you must do it in its entirety, without forgetting any instructions and understanding the goal. An "almost complete" project is usually a "completely incomplete" project for us. Pay particular attention to details. The only reliable source of information about the instructions is the 42 training team: hearsay is not to be trusted.

**You must finish all the required exercises.** 42 has no prejudice about your capacities and starts computer programming from ground level. Each exercise is a compulsory step in your training. Inasmuch, never start a higher level exercise before finishing the preceding ones: you will find yourself in difficulty. Hands-on experience is the only way to learn in 42 and is not to be considered lightly.

**42 does not give any solution to the exercises.** The school’s training method rests on intensive and exclusive use of hands-on experience. To give a solution is to prevent you from finding it by yourself. You will come across many questions during your 42 training. We will invite you to find the answers by yourself.

**Cheating is not being able to re-do an exercise.** Any student or workgroup that cannot reproduce a project behind closed doors is considered a cheater. Your greatest enemy is yourself: never think that you are certain to know, rather know and show it to us.

<h1>A for All the others: my engagements to my comrades</h1>

**A peer-to-peer method: everyone learns from others.** We learn better about what we have to transmit. Starting from there, during all your training, you will hold training sessions, look over exams, manage project presentations... you will refine your talent by helping others make progress in 42.


**Working in a group means exchanging points of view.** Each member of the group is responsible for the advancement of the project. Together, you have to define your goals and priorities and, most of all, exchange through dialogue. Each member can criticize the work of others so the group makes progress. Dividing work might seem a good idea, but in the long term can be detrimental to your learning.

**Your training is done in school.** You will make progress in 42 by confronting your points of view, and by doing so, you will make your comrades progress. In this logic, you should agree to meet at the school to work on your projects and refrain from being alone or in a group somewhere else.

**Working in a group does not mean letting the group do the work for you.** When you’re thinking together about a project, you have to recreate it individually from scratch. Group interactions can sometimes lead to a false sensation of understanding which can only be detected by individual practice. When a member of a workgroup was unable to re-do the exercise, the group must meet again to start the resolution process again.

**Group problems are to be dealt with inside the group.** For many of you, this new method of working will be a discovery. We know by experience that many confrontations will happen. You must learn to defuse a crisis before it arrives. Bad group management is not a reason for failing the project.

<h1>N for Nothing without else: my engagements to 42</h1>

**42, a school of passion.** The school is designed to enable individuals that are not in the traditional system to live their passion for computers. Your personal motivation should enable you to advance in the offered projects. When you find yourself in difficulty, you have to exchange with other students or the training team to make progress. They are just as passionate as you.

**Flawless personal attitude.** By taking charge of your studies, you cannot blame others for your mistakes anymore. When you engage yourself with your group, the training team or administration, you must do whatever you can to meet that engagement. This includes, among other things, acute punctuality at any moment in your 42 training.

**Respect of individuals and equipment.** You must never be insulting to the 42 team or other students. You must follow all instructions given to you by members of the administration and the training team. In the same logic, you must not deteriorate any equipment or abuse of resources at your disposal. All illegal activities are forbidden.

**42, an open school.** To enable peer-to-peer training, the school is open 24/7. You are invited to intensively profit from it. Some people are wrong when they think that "holidays" have no meaning. It’s wrong. We think that holidays are a synonym of working in a group on the 42 campus.

Failure to meet or follow the guidelines can lead to temporary or definitive exclusion without any recourse possible.

The 42KL team.

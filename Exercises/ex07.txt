The prototype of printf is as follow:
int  printf(char *s, ...);

There's a difference of behaviour of when passing a string literal to the first argument than passing a string pointer
Example:

int  main()
{
  char *p = "Hello %x world!\n";

  printf("Hello %x world!\n", 100, 200, 300); // Example 1 with string literal
  printf(p, 100, 200, 300); // Example 2 passing string pointer to first argument
}

Predict the difference!






Only read below after the exercise:
The printf with the string pointer will pass compiler warning of unused variable while the most common usage of printf with
string literal won't pass compiler warning

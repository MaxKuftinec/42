This exercise is about distance of variable with data type 'type (*)[n]'

If nothing is written yet, then write one

What would happen if we compile the code below? Predict the outcome before compiling!

#include <stdio.h>

int  main()
{
  char a[50];
  char b[100];

  printf("Distance: %lu\n", &a - &b);
}

Compile a run program that uses preprocessor macro with flag '-D'


Only read this after performing exercise: Any variable(not limited to macro) can be defined during the compilation process. For example: if we have 1 undefined variables and 1 macro as below, we can define them during the compilation process

#include <stdio.h>

#ifndef NUMBER
#define NUMBER 42
#endif

int  main()
{
  printf("NUMBER + variable = %d\n", NUMBER + variable);
}

Compilation command: clang -D NUMBER=13 -D variable=42 main.c
Expected output: NUMBER + variable = 55

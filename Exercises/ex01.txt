Run a random number generator with range of -2147483648 to 2147483647 and assign this number to an int data type
Predict what character will appear on the stdout with the write system call (1, &a, 4)
If the byte cannot represent an ascii value, predict the value of the decimal. Verify with printf with %d specifier

State 2 important conclusion that can be made from this exercise
- The computer store bytes in backward manner
- int can be treated as char if we read it byte by bite

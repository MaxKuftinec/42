Create a program that demonstrate the linking of a variable in 2 function. Context:

#include <stdio.h>

void  foo(int nb)
{
  nb++;
}

void  foo2(char *buffer)
{
  while(*buffer)
    (*buffer = 97, buffer++);
}

int  main()
{
  int   nb = 42;
  char  buffer[] = "Hello world!\n";

  foo(nb);
  foo2(buffer);
  printf("%d\n", nb);
  printf("%s\n", buffer);
}

Predict what happen in the program above. If you think the output is not as it is intended to be, write the correct linkage

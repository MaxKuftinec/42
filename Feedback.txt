The team consists of 3, Bryan, Jiun and Fatih who had no prior extensive knowledge on programming. Bryan and Fatih came from engineering background while Jiun work in office and may have deal with Excel tasks. All 3 is currently employed.

Bryan requested and was granted a paid leave from his employer in Sabah just to allocate 1 month of time for Piscine. As someone who spent a lot of time in the campus for the past week, I do notice that Bryan is spending a lot of time in the campus studying. He is eager to learn. Bryan is the most articulate and expressive of the team. He asked me a lot of questions and seems to demonstrate a better understanding for C relative to his teammates, given that exposure to C for 1 week only.



Their program able to run according to the desired output from the subject pdf. Critical case such as -ve, 0 and 1 was handled well. Since their program work as intended, I spent most of the time testing their understanding for what they implemented. There was one red flag. They don't know that it is possible to exclude the bracket for control statement (if, while) if the content consists of only one line to execute, yet they have implemented it multiple times in their code. I point out this explicitly to give them the benefit of the doubt hoping they won't repeat this particular attitude again because I suspect those are copy pasted lines. But I will give a pass for this one

The team does not yet know, that they cannot pass a string literal to a function that takes a char argument except for Bryan who was barely able to predict the outcome when a string or character literal is passed to these functions.
